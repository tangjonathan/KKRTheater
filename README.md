# KKRTheater


Entity Framework Core Code First was used to develop the Database as I coded. Please run the SQL scripts in your preferred server location to create and seed the data for the application. 

The app was deployed to production if you'd like to run it via the DLL. This can be run with the command `dotnet KKRTheather.dll` in the appropriate file directory.

In the [appsettings.json](https://github.com/tangjonathan/KKRTheater/blob/master/KKRTheater/Development/KKRTheater/appsettings.json) file, please ensure to update the ConnectionString to where you have hosted the database under "ConnectionStrings"
